## Overview

The goal of this project was to deconstruct an e-commerce site into a smaller piece that can build my development skills and utilize in future projects. This design was replicated from Frontend Mentor which gave me a good starting point of how I expected things to look. Overall the process was quick and established once again, my understanding of state management fundamentals, CSS design, and understanding of constructing HTML for proper blueprints. React was the framework I used which is great for splitting up each section into various components that render and re-render based on events that can occur.

### Goal

Users will be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
