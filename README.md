## Overview

The goal of this project is to deconstruct an e-commerce site into a smaller piece that can build my development skills and utilize in future projects.

### Goal

Users will be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

This section will be updated as I progress through the application. Stay tuned!
